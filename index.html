  </h1>
  <p>
    croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using
    the
    French yeast-leavened laminated dough.Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered
    with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
    laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.<br />
    Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.
    Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern croissant was
    developed
    in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened
    laminated
    dough. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast
    food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor.
